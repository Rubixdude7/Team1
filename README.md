Project Background:
Access to reliable and professional counselling for kids is not easy in developing countries such as Jakarta. In an effort to make it readily accessible we propose the creation of a web application that will serve as a system that will enable patients from all over Indonesia to receive counselling from a verified and credible psychologist. The focus of this system is to provide counselling to the most vulnerable member of the community which are kindergarten up to high school kids.
